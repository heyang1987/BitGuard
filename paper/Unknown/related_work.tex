Hierachically, the approaches to mitigate SEU consists of three categories.

1. Improve the device level robustness. (IBM silicon on chip paper.)

2. Improve the design level robustnss. (TMR papers, seustatics paper)

3. Improve the system level robusteness. 
First, hardening the latch circuit. 
 
(SEUhardenedByDesignLatchLevel paper)

Second, EADC code could be used to detect SEU. 

( SpaceCraftsThatUsesEADC(Hamming)paper.)

Hamming code could be used to mitigate SEU in both circuit level and in system level. Existing researches uses hamming code to harden the 8051 micro-controller's fault-tolerance against SEU.


(HammingEnhanced8051 paper)
(SEUmitigationUsingHammingCode) 

Hamming code has the deficiency when using in system level, that it must have fixed length data input to code into a code word.
