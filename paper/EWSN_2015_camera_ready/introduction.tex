One high-energy ionizing particle passing through an integrated circuit can release enough charge to change the state of a binary digit, causing a stored bit to change to its opposite value (i.e., a 0-bit can become a 1-bit, and vice-versa~\cite{fundamentals:space}). The results can range from system malfunction to system crash.

Modern approaches used to prevent and correct SEU errors often introduce additional hardware to the target system. In this paper, we present a {\em software-only} approach that detects and corrects SEUs in RAM. The paper focuses on the system stack, which is the most important and dynamic region in memory. The system stack is protected by injecting code into the target assembly generated by AVR-GCC. Our approach does not introduce additional hardware, and since it operates at the assembly level, it is language and application neutral.
