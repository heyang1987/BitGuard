The single event upset is among the most common types of system faults introduced by radiation, posing significant risk to spacecraft embedded systems. Modern approaches to guarding against such faults typically introduce additional hardware to detect and correct SEU errors in target systems. In this paper, we present a software-only approach to protecting embedded system memory from SEUs, focused on the system stack. The stack is protected by injecting auxiliary assembly code within the target program. The prototype implementation is based on the AVR architecture, but is easily adapted to other architectures. Analytical and experimental results show that our approach detects and corrects SEU errors as expected.
